## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. if there is a website you'd like to add just create the file with the name of the website. if you like can enheritance from the BasicActions class just to avoid repeting things such as cleaning the console or getting a response printed, but since websites are pretty unique most of the time you'll have to implement it.
